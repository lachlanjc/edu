# Observations on my wearables

As far as traditional tech wearables, my setup is super popular: Apple Watch, AirPods Pro 2 out & about, AirPods Max when I’m at the office/in deep work. Apple Watch & AirPods (Pro) once communicated (since I bought all of the above on launch day) I was a super early adopter, and incidentally indicated a level of status. But they don’t communicate much these days, as they’re so ubiquitous, especially on the NYU campus. And I’ve [written previously](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2021-01-15_airpods_max_are_priced_perfectly) about what AirPods Max communicate—namely that they’re a fashion accessory as much as they are headphones. You’ll regularly see me use gestures like Double Tap on Apple Watch and squeeze on AirPods.

I hosted an event with [Humane](https://Humane.com) at ITP this week, and wearing an Ai Pin is an even more extreme version of the OG Apple Watch feeling, since it doesn’t blend in as being a watch; it stands out brightly on nearly any outfit on the lapel, communicating you’re super into cutting-edge consumer tech and have disposable income. I know that’s not the designers’ stated intention, but it’s unavoidable.

In high school, when I was active doing [political organizing](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2018-11-03_trans_rights), I often wore political pins about queer/trans rights to school, which telegraphed my values, reminded people of my pronouns, etc. Those were perceived more differently by the multitude of demographics at my high school, though no one directly talked to me about them. When a state senator who supported arming teachers visited my high school, I posed for a photo wearing a pin of a local candidate who didn’t. These days, I’m more likely to wear a laser-cut strawberry pin from recent ITP grad [Priyanka](https://www.priyankamakin.com/), which adds cuteness and ITP-style fun to my outfit.

## Reading: [Make Wearable Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Wearable-Electronics-prototype-interactive/dp/1449336515), Ch 1

- I didn’t encounter any new concepts in this chapter, but it was a great refresher since it’s been two years since I took [Physical Computing](/courses/pcomp). 
- I’ve never calculated voltage/resistance using the basic formula for one of my circuits. It’s a goal for myself this semester to do that so I have a better understanding of them.
- I’ve only ever used solidcore wires & breadboards for circuits, never flexible materials, but excited to try some this semester!
