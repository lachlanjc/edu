# Measurement project: glossary

1. The **[thermoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect)** is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage. This voltage can be used to measure temperature (it’s how a thermocouple works), or to generate electricity, which I’ll be using: specifically, the thermodynamically-reversible Peltier–Seebeck effect.
2. The heat/energy source of my battery is still tbd, but ideally would be **solar thermal** (using heat from the sun to heat the sand) and/or potentially **solar photoelectric** (using electricity from the sun through a photovoltaic panel to heat the sand).
3. The battery will be a **[thermal flywheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_mass)**, where the heat stored provides inertia against outside temperature fluctuations.
