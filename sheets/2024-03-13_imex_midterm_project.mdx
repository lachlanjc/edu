# Midterm project

We tend to think of energy and waste as two separate streams. But producing (useful) energy produces waste. I read [this article on solar waste](https://www.distilled.earth/p/the-solar-waste-problem-in-context) a few months ago, and began wondering about waste from burning coal.

Coal, I learned, leaves 10-15% of its volume behind after burning, in the form of super-toxic coal ash. This ash leaks into waterways, blows into the air, gets stored in landfills. In the U.S. a chunk of the unimaginably-vast supply of this “resource” is [re-used](https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-reuse) for road-building, as an ingredient in concrete. I found [this article](https://energynews.us/2022/08/31/the-solution-to-americas-colossal-coal-ash-problem/) enlightening. It included this tidbits:

> From 2000 to 2017, 118.4 million tons of coal ash were beneficially used, according to Earthjustice: Enough to cover a six-lane highway from Washington, D.C. to Sydney, Australia.

Virtual reality may not be an [empathy machine](/2024-03-13_imex_empathy_in_virtual_reality), but it’s great at communicating scale in realer terms.

## 3D modeling

I’ve used Blender a tiny bit in high school, but this week I had to dust those few skills off and learn a redesigned UI. I modeled a basic coal power plant, a pile of coal, and a precisely-10%-the-volume pile of coal ash.

## Unity

This was my first time using Unity, and I struggled.
