# Measurement project sources

- My previous project, while I continue to believe it will be important for the future of household decarbonization, [SPAN electrical panels](https://www.span.io/) are working on, and I don’t think I’ll learn a lot from the measurements/models I make for forecasting/redistributing household electrical demand throughout the day. Changing gears.
- One of the big not-clearly-solved problems in decarbonization is industrial heat: it makes up 10% of our global emissions, and it’s been historically seen as the hardest sector to decarbonize. [See background on this topic](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/10/20904213/climate-change-steel-cement-industrial-heat-hydrogen-ccs), or [this study](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/low-carbon-heat-solutions-heavy-industry-sources-options-and-costs-today).
- A new solution has emerged: thermal batteries charged by cheap, renewable electricity. [This paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00121/full) gives background. (A company has emerged to commercialize this solution, [Rondo](https://rondo.com/), which I heard about via [this Volts article](https://www.volts.wtf/p/why-electrifying-industrial-heat#details).) Making a cheap, crude imitation, I’m curious if I can make my own thermal battery out of sand, charge it with a solar panel (or other power source if the math doesn’t work for the solar panel), store that energy in the sand, then measure how much energy I can get back out, which I could turn into an LED, spinning motor, etc.
- This (hilarious, British) man made a [tutorial of a DIY sand battery](https://hackaday.com/2022/11/21/making-a-do-it-yourself-sand-battery/). Based on introductory understanding, I need to acquire sand, a container, a resistive heating element [like this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1481), and a [Peltier device](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1330). I don’t yet understand if Peltier devices are reversible, as in, if this module generates electricity the way a DC motor/generator does; I may need a different component?
