## Fabric stores

**B&J Fabrics** was a great store to start at—while there’s a very wide range of fabrics, it’s less stressful to be in than others. The employees were also the nicest/calmest of any of the stores. I walked in expecting the store to be organized by fabric type, which it was, but that each specific fabric would then be in a range of colors; I’m not sure if they have those just not on display, or each fabric really is a specific combination of color/weight/material/brand/texture that is not offered in much of a spectrum. I discovered so many fabric types I’ve never heard of, like triacetate; so many more synthetics and synthetic blends in more textures than I think of synthetics offering. The swatching process was easy and friendly, but I left already a little overwhelmed, though it was my first of eight stops.

The other fabric stores were more industrial, less friendly, and harder to navigate. **Spandex House**, whose latest interior renovation might’ve been to put up a “Like us on Facebook” poster when I was in elementary school, had little organization I could discern other than patterns on the ground floor and solids up above (if you can find the stairs). **Mood**’s multi-floor structure and intricacies make it especially tiring. The range of options is stunning, but if you’re buying materials for a specific project, you definitely need a game plan going in, because a day of browsing in the Garment District will not take you to any specific destination.

Sadly, Mood’s dog Swatch died in 2022, and I never got to meet him:

## Notion stores

The trimmings/notion stores, while also dizzyingly diverse, I found easier to navigate, because there are sections for the major types of hardware and tools, and you can find specific types, colors, or specifications fairly rapidly. **Pacific Trimming** was my favorite for feeling so bountiful and well-lit; **Steinlauf & Stoller** was the emptiest; **Hai Feathers** had some big camp/drag energy; **Sil Thread** was the most industrial supply but super thorough in their zipper selection.

Thread at **Steinlauf & Stoller** was in the range of $10 for 1200 yards.

YKK separating invisible zippers were $8.95 for 28” in any color at **Sil Thread**:

## Tools

I discovered the Bodkin, which is a tool for pulling elastics and drawstrings through a textile project:

The chalk wheel kit lets you cut a circle of any radius without a template object to cut around, by drawing a chalk circle onto your textile first.
