Inspired by an interactive experience from the [Our Choice eBook from 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20120224201011/http://pushpoppress.com/ourchoice/), this installation lets you explore producing wind electricity yourself, and the role battery storage plays in a renewable grid.

## Energy & power

- The stepper motor converts rotational kinetic energy to AC electricity. The full-bridge rectifier converts the AC power to DC. The capacitor stores this energy, allowing the LEDs to remain illuminated for a minute after the stepper motor stops being turned.
- Via measurement:
	- Open circuit voltage: 20.3V
	- Short circuit current: 35-40 mA
	- Upper power bound: 0.73 W
- Via calculation:
	- Initial voltage in the capacitor: 0.001 V
	- Voltage in the capacitor when charged: 14.88 V
	- Energy intially: 0 J
	- Energy when charged: 1.107 J
	- Duration of change: 18 sec
	- Observed power: 0.0615 W

## Process

### 3D printing

Andr√©s linked me [the stepper motor handle](https://www.stlfinder.com/model/stepper-motor-hand-crank-updated-g7bKQLTL/5124037/) STL file he used, which I downloaded, then redesigned using Blender to design my propellers. I printed the file and hot-glued it to the stepper motor.
